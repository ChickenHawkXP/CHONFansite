        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Chon began in 2008 with the recording 
        of their four-track self-titled demo. In 2010, the band began a brief hiatus, 
        but reunited in 2011 to record two new songs, "O.G." and "Breathe". They returned in 
        2013 with the release of their debut EP entitled Newborn Sun. The following year Chon 
        released their second EP, entitled Woohoo!. In 2014, Chon embarked on two consecutive nationwide
        tours with Animals as Leaders. In December 2014, Chon signed with the record label Sumerian 
        Records, and announced they would be releasing their debut full-length album the following 
        year. On February 5, 2015, the band announced their debut full length titled Grow would 
        be released in March 2015. On March 5, the band premiered their song "Can't Wait" from the 
        album via Red Bull. They released the album on March 24. Eight days prior the band embarked 
        on a 27 date tour supporting Circa Survive. On December 16, 2015, Chon announced their 
        first full US headlining tour, titled the Super Chon Bros Tour, with accompanying bands Polyphia and
        Strawberry Girls. They sold out every single show on the tour Chon was also an opening band 
        during the Sonic Unrest Tour, featuring headliner Periphery, and bands Sikth and Toothgrinder.</p>

        <h4>Equipment</h4>
        <p>Chon endorses Ibanez guitars and Overdrive Straps guitar straps. Guitarist Mario Camarena 
            currently rotates between 2 different Ibanez AZ model protypes â€“ one white and one pink 
            with white pickguard, an Ibanez RG652fx with a custom floral print (including a black Yoshi 
            character which Mario uses as his main in Super Smash Bros), and an Ibanez S5521Q. He can also 
            often be seen playing a custom RG created by Seth Hollander. Before "Homey" album, Mario used a 
            Vox AC30 tube amplifier and a Fender Super Sonic, but has now switched to a Matchless amplifier. 
            Erick Hansel primarily plays a custom Ibanez AZ prototype, a RG652FX with a custom paint dip, a 
            RG321MH (early albums and performances) and a prestige Ibanez Talman. Recently Erick has been seen with 
            either a Vox AC30 or Matchless amplifier. Chon's early work was known to largely shun the use of 
            effects pedals, but the band has since started experimenting heavily with pedals during the 
            writing process for Homey.</p>

            <h4>Musical Influence</h4>
            <p>In the early days the band were influenced by metal bands such as Necrophagist and post-hardcore 
                band The Fall of Troy, but the band have also listed pianists such as Hiromi Uehara, Tigran Hamasyan, 
                and Alex Argento as influences in their sound. Chon's music is noted for its use of complex harmony 
                with heavy emphasis on seventh chords, as well as the odd time signatures and polyrhythms typical of 
                the progressive rock genre. Their latest release Homey, saw the band incorporating elements of trip-hop and
                 electronic music, which can be heard in tracks such as 'Nayhoo.'</p>
